# Tabu-Search
Basic implementation of Tabu search for solved a minimization problem, 
you can use change the code if you want to solve another problem, 
only make sure that the structure of the algorithm is the same.

The most important thing about the code is that i use QT libs, if you doesn't want 
use them change  cdouts to your way of write on files or just print on the console 
,also change the Qlists to c++ standard vectors.

Please give me all the possible feedback, i'll appreciate it.

The comments on the code are in spanish, so if you have questions just ask.
