# Tabu-Search
Basic implementation of Tabu search for solved a minimization problem, 
you can use change the code if you want to solve another problem, 
only make sure that the structure of the algorithm is the same.

The most important thing about the code is that i use QT libs, if you doesn't want 
use them, just change all the cdouts to normals couts and also change the Qlists to c++ standard vectors.

Please give me all the possible feedback, i'll appreciate it.
